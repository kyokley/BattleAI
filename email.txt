Announcements!

There are only a couple of days left to sure up your battleship AIs. I hope all of you have used your time wisely and are ready for the big competition.

As the submission deadline approaches, there are a few things that must be done to ensure a valid entry:

1. Make sure your submission is contained in a module with your initials appended to the end. For example, my AI is named Admiral so my module should be named admiralky. If you need help creating a module, we will be glad to help.
2. Make sure to upgrade to the latest versions of the BattlePy code by running (in a virtualenv, of course)

        git pull origin master
        pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

3. Run your AI one more time to be certain you've gotten all the bugs out.
4. Finally, zip or tar your module and email it to this address. Submissions will be accepted starting now. Any submissions made after 3pm on Wednesday (8/5) will not be accepted.

All submissions will be checked to make sure they do not violate the spirit of the competition. Any strategy that is found to be in violation of any of the competition rules will be removed from the tournament.

Happy Hunting
